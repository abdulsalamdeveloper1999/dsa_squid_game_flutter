# Squid Game DSA 🎮

**Squid Game DSA** is an interactive and fun way to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using a game-inspired approach. This Flutter project brings the thrill of the popular *Squid Game* series to a coding challenge format, where players solve problems under time pressure while following the rules of "Red Light, Green Light."  

## Features 🚀

- **Red Light, Green Light Gameplay**:  
  Solve DSA problems during the "Green Light" phase and pause during the "Red Light" phase. Any keyboard activity during "Red Light" will result in elimination!  

- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**:  
  Problems are categorized as Easy, Medium, and Hard based on the Pareto principle, with varying time limits.  

- **Audio and Sound Effects**:  
  Immersive sound effects for gameplay, including Red Light, Green Light, and elimination sounds.  

- **Code Evaluation**:  
  Write and submit code directly in the app, with real-time feedback and test case validation.  

- **Scalability**:  
  Future updates will include multiplayer mode, leaderboards, and a battle royale-style elimination format.
